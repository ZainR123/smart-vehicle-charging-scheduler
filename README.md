# Smart Scheduling of Electric Vehicles

## COMP2002/G52 GRP: Software Engineering Group Project

### Team 9

The root directory for team 9's group project on the smart scheduling of electric vehicles.

#### Project Brief

*When everybody transitions from Petrol and Diesel cars to EV, will the grid be able to cope?*

*In winter 2019, an Atos colleague took a holiday in Norway. Driving to a ski resort near Oslo on a Friday evening, he discovered that the popularity of Electric Vehicles and abundance of charging points resulted in the electricity distribution system being unable to meet the peak requirement for demand.*

***Will the successful implementation of government policy to get petrol and diesel cars off the road by 2035 make it impossible for the national grid to cope? Or is there a smarter way to schedule the charging of electric vehicles to maximise the use of renewable electricity at times of peak supply?***
