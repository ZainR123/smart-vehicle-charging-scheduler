Abstract:
Since 2015, there has been an increase of over 4 million new electric cars on the road and up to 7 million charging stations. 
This has been an upward trend correlating with the rise in awareness of climate change, and its devastating effects on our world. 
However, with this growth of electric vehicles and an abundance of charging points, national grids have been struggling to meet this greater demand. 
To tackle this problem Team 9â€™s EV Scheduler attempts to solve this as an optimisation problem through smart allocation of vehicles based on environmental and energy factors.
